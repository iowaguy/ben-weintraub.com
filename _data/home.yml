  # About Me
  I am a final year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://cyber.northeastern.edu/">Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute</a> at Northeastern University where I work with <a href="https://cnitarot.github.io/">Cristina Nita-Rotaru</a>. I'm interested in the security of internet protocols. My research has mostly focused on validating the correctness of security-aware protocols from DNS to software-defined networks. My thesis work focuses on modeling and measuring scams and attacks on blockchains and Layer-2 protocols.

  **I am on the job market, please feel free to reach out with any research-related opportunities!**
